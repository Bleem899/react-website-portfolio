                <p>
                    - My technical skills aren't the most extensive. However, I am eager
                    to learn any skills that are necessary in order for me to do my job well.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    - I greatly enjoy learning new concepts, skills, and information that will
                     be directly applicable and impact myself or others around me.
